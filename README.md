Task: Generate a modern, professional, multi-page React portfolio website.

Requirements:
	•	Pages: Home, About Me, Achievements, Resume, Contact, “What’s in My Bag”, Skills/Languages. Each page should be separate, not a single-page scroll.
	•	Navbar: Sticky top navbar with links to each page. Smooth transitions between pages. Mobile-responsive.
	•	Home Page: Big hero section with my picture, name, tagline. Include a call-to-action button to go to About Me.
	•	About Me Page: Brief bio, profile picture, some personal info.
	•	Achievements Page: Showcase accomplishments, awards, projects, etc., in a clean card/grid layout.
	•	Resume Page: Display resume (PDF embed or styled HTML version). Include download button.
	•	Contact Page: Form with name, email, message, submit button (doesn’t need backend integration, just frontend mock).
	•	What’s in My Bag Page: Grid/list of daily items I use (e.g., laptop, headphones, notebook, etc.) with small pictures and descriptions.
	•	Skills/Languages Page: Icons or badges for programming languages and technologies I know.
	•	Design: Modern React with React Router for navigation. Clean, minimal but visually striking. Use CSS modules or styled-components. Hover effects, smooth animations, subtle shadows, gradient highlights.
	•	Extras: Responsive design, mobile-friendly, professional fonts, easy to customize colors and images.
	•	Tech stack: React (create-react-app or Vite), React Router, functional components with hooks.
	•	Output: Entire project structure ready to run locally with npm start or yarn start. Include placeholder images and placeholder text where needed.

Additional Notes:
	•	Make the design visually appealing, not cluttered.
	•	Each page should feel distinct but cohesive.
	•	Ensure the navbar highlights the active page.
	•	Include subtle transitions/animations for a “wow” factor.
